# Gambling-with-RL--WiDS
The main repo for the WiDS 2024 project - Gambling with RL

Here is the tentative timeline for the project-
### Week 1
We'll be focusing on the basics of RL and essential Python programming skills, laying the groundwork for further exploration.
### Week 2 
Let's dive into RL now with an introduction to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and the development of gridworld simulations. We will start with a frozen lake slippery walk environment helping you visualize agent behavior in a structured environment.
### Week 3 
Here we jump into algorithms for estimating state values and q-values where you'll implement value and policy iteration techniques to optimize decision-making.
### Week 4 
Here comes the first part of our final project. It challenges you to apply your knowledge by solving the game of Blackjack using Monte Carlo methods and Q-learning, honing your skills in practical problem-solving.
### Week 5 
Now we move to DRL to apply the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, where we'll be training an DRL(Deep Reinforcement Learning) agent in an Atari game using the OpenAI's Gymnasium Library
