# Gambling-with-RL--WiDS
The main repo for the WiDS 2024 project - Gambling with RL

Here is the tentative timeline for the project-
### Week 1
We'll be focusing on the basics of RL and essential Python programming skills, laying the groundwork for further exploration.  <br/>
Our main aim would be to get a general intro to RL and explore the fundamentals of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on their structure, components, and role in modeling decision-making in reinforcement learning.

### Week 2 
In this assignment, we'll use the simplest RL techniques - Policy and Value iteration to find the best policies (which maximize the discounted total reward) in our MDPs from last week.
### Week 3 
### Week 4 
### Week 5
